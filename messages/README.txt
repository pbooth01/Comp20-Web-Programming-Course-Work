The purpose of this lab was to load datat from a json file and then manipulate
the data. The particular json file that we were dealing with contained 
messages and the names of the people who wrote them.  Tom my knowledge, 
every aspect of the work is working correctly.

This project took me about 2 hrs to complete.

Yes, it is not possible to request the data from a different origin.
Normally, for security reasons, XMLHttpRequest requests follow the browser's
same origin policy, and only succeed if they are made to the host that 
served the original webpage.  Two pages have the same origin if the
protocol, port (if one is specified), and host are the same for both pages.
