The purpuse of this assigment was to create a map using the googlemaps
api, and use it to display the locations of others in the class.

The first part of the assignment consisted of retrieving your current
location and sending it to a data store that was created by Ming Chow.

The second part of the project consisted of retrieving JSON data and 
using it to display the locations of people in the class on the map.

To my knowledge, every aspect of the assignemnt works.

I worked with Sam Broner on this assignment, and also used many of the
resources that were provided by the professor. The general framework of
my code came from: https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/blob/gh-pages/examples/google_maps/geolocation_map.html.

I also used a resource for my haversive function: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript.

This assignment took me about 4 hours.
