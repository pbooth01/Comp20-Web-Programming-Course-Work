In this lab wew were given a sprite sheet that contained the pacman
gameboard as well as a bun ch of the characters from the game.  The 
goal of the lab was to use javascript to draw the blue gameboard, as
well as Ms. Pacman onto a web page.  To my knowledge, every aspect of
the lab works correctly.

I spent approximately an hour and a half on this lab.
