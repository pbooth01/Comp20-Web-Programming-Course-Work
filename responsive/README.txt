This assigment was to implament a css sprite. The web page index.html displays
an image in the top right corner, and the image changes as the width of the 
browser screen changes. Each image is actually part of the same large image
software.png, and the css just displays various parts of this image as the 
width of the browser window.  To my knowledge, everything in the assignment
works.

The assignment took about 2 hours to complete.
